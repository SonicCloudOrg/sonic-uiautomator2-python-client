### Background

At present, only one project [appium-uiautomator2-client](https://github.com/xsoloking/appium-uiautomator2-client) that bypasses Appium Server and interacts with appium-uiautomator2-server alone is seen on Github for Python, but it is not compatible The baseUrl of the latest appium-uiautomator2-server v5.x API has not been published on pypi. I tried to contact the author but there was no reply, so I decided to write a maintenance. For the Java version, you can see the [sonic-driver-core](https://github.com/SonicCloudOrg/sonic-driver-core) maintained by our organization.

### How to use

coming soon...
